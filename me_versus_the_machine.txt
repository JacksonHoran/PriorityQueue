The biggest difference between the two classes is that mine, uses a fixed size
allocation for the underlying array while the AI's class uses a dynamic python
list. They both work well in this situation but in terms of scalability and 
universality i think mine is better. It would be even better if i had
implemented some sort of dynamic resizing but for the sake of the assignment
it was not necesarry. Additionally the AI class tracks the size just using 
len(self.underlying) but mine tracks it manually. The biggest difference i would
say is in the heap maintaince methods. The AI class does not correctly maintain
the heap, it only checks the immediate relationships between parent and child
not checking it recursively. The AI peek_next method does not correctly get the
second most important either, it just gets the item at index 1 which is not
always the second most important. Finally, the AI class works has at worst
O(n) time in the extraction method, O(1) add, and O(1) peek. WHile that sounds
good for th add algorithm, it doesnt correctly maintain the heap. Mine however
has add and extract in O(log(n)) time and an O(1) peek time.
